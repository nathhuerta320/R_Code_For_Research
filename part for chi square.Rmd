The Chi- Square Test for Inedependence, denoted as $\chi^2$ is a comparison of 2 or more categorical variables. This test determines whether the variables are independent or dependent from each other. The $$\chi^2$$ is calculated by using a contingency table, a table of frequencies, with $r$ rows and $c$ columns. Once the contigency table is obtained, one is able to calculate the Chi- Square Test. The following equation is used to calculate $\chi^2$:
$$\chi^2 = \sum_{i,j} \frac{(O_{i,j} - {E_{i,j}})}{E_{i,j}}$$,
where $O$ is the observed frequency and $E$ is the expected frequency. The expected value for each cell in the contigency table is calculated by: 
$$E = \frac{\sum row \dot \sum column}{\text{Grand Total}$$. 


So, it tests This comparison is done by using a contingency table (i.e. a table of frequncies) (https://libguides.library.kent.edu/SPSS/ChiSquare).
