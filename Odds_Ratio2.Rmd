#What is odds ratio?

An odds ratio (OR) is a measure of association between exposure and an outcoms. It is a ratio of odds  describing an outcome occurring given a particular exposure as well as comparing the odds of the outcome occuring in the absence of a particular exposure. Odds Ratio is used in the following cases: 

1) Control Studies, where relative risks cannot be estimated (most commonly used)
2) Logistic Regression Analysis, ORs are computed during the analyses
3) Cross-Sectional Study Designs with Modifications
4) Cohort Study Designs with Modifications. 

An OR is the "odds of the outcome in one group by the the odds of outcome in the other group (analogous to relative risk)" (cite), ranging from zero to infinity. Hence, given condition A and condition B the odds ratio (OR) can be expressed as: 

$$OR = \frac{\frac{P(A)}{(1-P(A))}}{\frac{P(B)}{1-P(B)}}.    $$
Although odds ratio seems simple, they play several important roles. They are always valid measures of associations, but before computing an OR one must learn how to interpret it. (add more stuff later) 

#How to interpret odds ratio? 

An odds ratio is interpreted similar to relative risks (RR) but one should not confuse an odds ratio with RR. Based on a ratio obtained from condition A and condition B, OR can be interpreted in three manners: 

1) If the OR = 1, then exposure to condition A does not affect the odds of condition B.

2) If the OR >1, then there is higher odds of condition B happening when exposed to condition A. 

3) If the OR<1, then exposure is associated with lower odds of outcome. 

This may seem as a simple task but one must consider the significance of the odds ratio. If a positive OR is obtained, then does this mean we have a significant OR? Having a positive OR does not mean you have obtained a statistically significant result. In order to oder to obtain a statistically significant result one must consider the confidence interval (CI) and p-value. The 95% CI is used to measure the precision of the effect estimate of the OR. Confidence intervals are used to determine if the result from the OR lies in between the upper and lower confidence level. One should note, if the CI include 1, the OR is not statiscally significant. If the p-value > 0.05, then there is no statistical significance between the groups whereas if the p-value < 0.05, then it will be statistically significant. 

```{r}
#first you need to install the package fmsb
#install.packages("fmsb")

#then, install the fmsb library so you can run the odd ratios function 
library(fmsb)

#this will calculate the odds ratio. then call the function 
#oddsratio()
#sample code obtained from Rdocumentation 
#creates a 2 by 2 table like so this becomes the data to compute the OR
res <- oddsratio(5, 10, 85, 80)
#list the p.value, confidence interval, estimate?, method, and data.name
 str(res)
# prints out Odds ratio estimate and its significance probability 
 print(res)
#compute the odds ratio. not really sure what this part of the code dos 
 oddsratio(12, 5, 6, 12)
 oddsratio(12, 5, 6, 12, p.calc.by.independence=FALSE)
 DH <- sample(c("Disease", "Health"), 100, replace=TRUE)
 EN <- sample(c("Exposed", "Nonexposed"), 100, replace=TRUE)
 x <- table(EN, DH)
 oddsratio(x)
