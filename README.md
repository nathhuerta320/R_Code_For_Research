# R_Code_For_Research
This contains R codes for the project. 
Some of the code is commented and also includes questionsI asked myself to get an idea of needed to be done. If someone helped me code, then I acknowledged the help. Some things that should be noted is that this repository contains attempts that faild and were sucessful throughout the project. I did not delete any finals because many of the files contained simliar names and I was unsure of what file was working code and what was not.
